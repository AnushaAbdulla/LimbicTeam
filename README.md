## **Project Overview**  
ADHD is one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders among children and adolescents, with varying manifestations across genders. While boys are typically diagnosed at higher rates, evidence suggests that girls with ADHD often go undiagnosed due to their tendency to exhibit inattentive rather than hyperactive symptomsâ€”making these more challenging to detect. The consequences of undiagnosed ADHD in girls can lead to prolonged struggles with mental health, academic challenges, and difficulties in social functioning. By addressing these inequities, the WiDS Datathon tackles a critical issue in public health: ensuring timely and accurate diagnosis for all individuals, regardless of gender.

The WiDS Datathon 2025 allows participants to use functional brain imaging data, along with socio-demographic and emotional information, to address disparities in ADHD diagnosis between sexes. Participants are tasked with building a multi-outcome model to predict ADHD diagnosis and gender, uncovering critical insights into brain activity patterns associated with these outcomes. Break Through Tech AI supports this effort by fostering inclusion and diversity, ensuring that underrepresented groups in AI and data science are empowered to make impactful contributions to this critical field

The work conducted in this datathon holds significant potential to advance ADHD research and healthcare equity. Improving diagnostic tools, particularly for females who are often underdiagnosed, enables earlier interventions and better mental health outcomes. Insights into sex-specific brain activity patterns can also drive personalized treatments, leading to more effective and targeted therapies. Furthermore, the findings contribute to the scientific understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders while promoting fairness in healthcare access. Ultimately, this project showcases how AI can address societal challenges and improve lives through innovative health research. 


## Objectives and Goals

This project involves building a model following these tasks:
- **Predict ADHD Diagnosis**: Using features derived from functional brain imaging and socio-demographic data, the model determines whether an individual has ADHD (`ADHD_Outcome: 1 for Yes, 0 for No`).
- **Predict Gender**: The model also predicts the participant's sex (`Sex_F: 1 for Female, 0 for Male`), accounting for gender-specific differences in brain activity patterns.  

The model aims to optimize predictions while addressing biases in ADHD diagnosis and improving understanding of how the disorder manifests across the sexes.

The objectives of this challenge include:
1. **Advance ADHD Research**: Shed light on brain activity patterns that differ by gender in individuals with ADHD by understanding brain mechanisms and identifying functional connectivity patterns and socio-demographic factors linked to ADHD across sexes.
2. **Create Multi-Outcome Predictions**: Build a model capable of predicting both ADHD diagnosis and gender in individuals based on their data.
3. **Promote Equity and Drive Impactful Outcomes**: Highlight and address gender disparities in the diagnosis and understanding of ADHD. Contribute to personalized medicine by improving ADHD diagnosis and treatment strategies for both males and females.
